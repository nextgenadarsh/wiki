# Object Oriented Programming (OOPs)

- Refers to languages that `uses objects` in programming.
- Aims to mirror `real-world entities` like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism etc in programming.
- The main aim of OOP is to `bind together the data and the functions` that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.

## Basic Concepts / Terminologies

### Access Modifiers

- control where can it be accessed
- Access specifiers in Java:
  - public: accessible in `all class` in your application
  - protected: accessible `within the package` in which it is defined and in its `subclass(es)`(including subclasses declared outside the package
  - private: accessible `only within the class` in which it is defined.
  - default (declared/defined without using any modifier): accessible `within same class` and `package` within which its class is defined.

### Return type

The data type of the value returned by the method or void if does not return a value

### Method Name: the rules for field names apply to method names as well, but the convention is a little different.
- Parameter list: Comma separated list of the input parameters are defined, preceded with their data type, within the enclosed parenthesis. If there are no parameters, you must use empty parentheses ().
- Exception list: The exceptions you expect by the method can throw, you can specify these exception(s).
- Method body: it is enclosed between braces. The code you need to be executed to perform your intended operations.
