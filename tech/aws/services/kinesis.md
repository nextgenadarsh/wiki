Amazon Kinesis
---

- Allows customers to connect, `process, and analyze real-time streaming data` to quickly gather `insights` to the incoming data flow of information.
- `Use case` for Amazon Kinesis is for `ingesting, buffering, and processing streaming video, audio applications, logs, website click-streams, and IoT telemetry data` for machine learning, analysis, and storage at any scale.

# Amazon Kinesis Video Streams

- Use the Kinesis Video Streams SDK to develop applications with `connected camera devices`, such as phones, drones, and dash cams, to securely stream video to custom real-time or batch-oriented applications running on AWS EC2 instances.
- The video streams can also be stored and encrypted for further monitoring and analytics.

# Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose

- Streaming data is `collected and delivered in real time` to Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Open Search Service, custom HTTP/HTTPS endpoints, and to third-party service providers including Splunk, Datadog, and LogicMonitor.
- Can also be configured to `transform data records` before the data is stored.

# Amazon Kinesis Data Streams

- `Collect and process` gigabytes of streaming `data that is generated continuously from thousands of locations` such as log files, e-commerce purchases, game player activity, web click-stream data, and social media information.
- Multiple data streams ingested into Kinesis are sent into custom applications running on EC2 instances, or data stored in a DynamoDB table, Amazon S3 storage, Amazon EMR, or Amazon Redshift.
