AWS Trusted Advisor
---

- A built-in management service that executes several essential checks against your AWS account resources.
- Every AWS account has access to several core AWS Trusted Advisor checks, and access to the `AWS Personal Health Dashboard`, which alerts you when specific resources you are using at AWS are having issues.
- The following are core AWS Trusted Advisor checks:
  - Security checks include permission checks for EBS and RDS snapshots that are marked public, S3 buckets that have open access, checking for the creation of at least one IAM user, and root accounts that donâ€™t have MFA enabled.
  - AWS Trusted Advisor checks various AWS services and alerts when usage is greater than 80% of the current service quota limits in force, including IAM users, Amazon S3 buckets created, VPCs created, and Auto Scaling groups.
- Can also provide `additional checks` if your organization has purchased `Business or Enterprise support`.
- Full AWS Trusted Advisor checks provide recommendations for improving `performance, security, fault tolerance, and cost-effectiveness`.
- Useful to run against AWS account resources to review current security issues and any flagged service quotas.
