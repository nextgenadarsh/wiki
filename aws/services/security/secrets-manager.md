AWS Secrets Manager
---

- Enables you to `store, rotate, and manage organizational secrets` used to access your applications, services, and IT resources.
- You can securely store and manage secrets, such as database credentials and API keys, helping reduce the risk of secrets being compromised and meet compliance requirements.
- Enables you to secure and manage secrets for SaaS applications, SSH keys, RDS databases, third-party services, and on-premises resources.
- You can also store credentials for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Amazon Aurora, and Oracle databases hosted on EC2 instances and OAuth refresh tokens used when accessing third-party services and on-premises resources.
- Applications that are running on `EC2 instances` hosted within a VPC can use a `private interface endpoint` to `connect` directly to AWS `Secrets Manager` across the AWS private network.
