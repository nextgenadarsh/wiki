AWS Shield (Standard and Advanced)
---

# Standard Protection

- Provides protection against distributed denial of service attacks (`DDoS`).
- Protects AWS infrastructure and ingress paths at each edge location for all AWS customers.
- Provides `basic DDoS protection` for known Layer 3 and Layer 4 attacks using AWS Web Application Firewall `(WAF) rules` deployed and managed by AWS.

# Advanced Protection

- Utilizes an expert AWS DDoS response team with a `15-minute SLA` response protecting your workload components (Amazon EC2 instances, AWS Elastic Load Balancers, Amazon CloudFront distributions, AWS Global Accelerator deployments, and Route 53 resources).
- Get access to a global threat dashboard.
- Provides `cost protection`, which saves customers money when workload compute resources are required to scale due to illegitimate demand placed on the workload cloud services by a DDoS attack. AWS refunds the additional resources cost.
