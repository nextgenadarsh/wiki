Amazon API Gateway
---

- is located `between your client applications and back-end services`.
- is a service that makes it easy to `create, publish, maintain, and secure APIs`.
- provides features such as `authentication and authorization, rate limiting, and caching`, to help ensure that APIs are secure and scalable.
- It also provides `tools for monitoring and analyzing API usage` and performance.
- supports `HTTP, REST`, and `WebSocket` APIs

# API
An application programming interface (API) is `a set of rules and protocols for building software applications`.

- **The A**, for application, could be a custom function, the entire app, or something in between.
- **The P** is related to the type of programming language or platform that created the API.
- **The I** is for interface, and API Gateway interfaces with HTTP/REST APIs and/or WebSocket APIs. Java API types can direct HTTP requests across the private AWS network. Hosted APIs are exposed publicly using HTTPS endpoints.

# Features of API Gateway

- `Security`
  - API Gateway `supports AWS IAM and Amazon Cognito` for authorizing API access.
- Traffic `throttling`
  - It is possible to cache API responses for incoming requests; cached responses can be answered for an API call with the same query. The number of requests each API can receive can be defined, with usage plans defining an APIâ€™s allowed level of traffic.
- `Multi-version support`
- `Metering`: Metering allows you to throttle and control desired access levels to a hosted API.
- `Authorized access`
  - When an AWS API is called, API Gateway checks whether authentication is required before the task that the API has requested is carried out.
  - Authentication options are an `AWS Lambda authorizer` or Amazon `Cognito user pool`.
  - API Gateway calls the selected authorizer, passing the incoming authorization token for verification.
  - An Amazon Cognito user pool can be configured for authenticating the mobile application using various methods, including single sign-on (SSO), OAuth, or an email address to access the backend application components.

<h2 style="background-color:lightgreen">API Gateway Cheat Sheet</h2>

- With API Gateway, developers can `publish, maintain, and secure` APIs at `any scale`.
- API Gateway can process hundreds of thousands of `concurrent API calls`.
- API Gateway `works together with Lambda` to create application-facing serverless infrastructure.
- Amazon CloudFront distributions can be used as a public endpoint for API Gateway requests.
- Edge-optimized APIs can be used for clients in different geographic locations. API requests are routed to the closest edge location.
- Regional API endpoints can be used by clients located in the same AWS region.
- Private API endpoints can be accessed from a VPC using an interface VPC endpoint.
- API Gateway can scale to any traffic level required.
- API Gateway logs track performance metrics for the backend, including - API calls, latency, and error rates.
- API Gateway only charges when your hosted APIs are called. Charges are based on the amount of data that is transferred outbound.
- API requests can be throttled to prevent overloading your backend services.
