VPC Gateway Endpoint

# Private VPC Interface Endpoint

- Allows private access to S3
- Require route table entries

VPC Gateway endpoints are attached to your VPC and use a route in the associated subnetâ€™s route table to connect to the target service. They can be used to connect to Amazon S3 and DynamoDB, as shown in Figure 11-35. VPC Gateway endpoints are not charged for creation and data transfer.

Endpoint policies can be deployed to further define the endpoint access rules. The default policy allows full access to the service; this default policy should be evaluated and changed if necessary. Custom endpoint policies control access from the VPC through the gateway endpoint to the service from the EC2 instance.
