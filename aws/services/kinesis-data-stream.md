# Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose

- `captures, transforms, and loads streaming data into services` such as Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon Elasticsearch Service, without the need to write any custom code.
- enables users to set up a data stream and specify a destination for the data, such as an S3 bucket or a Redshift cluster.
- Amazon Data Firehose will then automatically deliver the data to the specified destination, applying any necessary transformations or enrichments along the way.

# The Amazon Kinesis Video Streams SDK

- enables connected camera devices, such as phones, drones, and dashcams, to securely stream video to custom real-time or batch-oriented applications running on AWS EC2 instances.
- The video streams can also be stored and encrypted for further monitoring and analytics.

# Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics

- is a service offered by AWS for real-time analysis of streaming data. Amazon Data Analytics enables users to run SQL queries on streaming data, providing the ability to build applications that can analyze and process data in real time.
- Amazon Data Analytics also integrates with other AWS services, such as Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon EMR, allowing users to easily move and analyze data stored in those services.
