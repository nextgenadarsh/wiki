Compute Services and Use Cases
---

Compute Type  | Compute Service | Use Case
--  | --  | --
EC2 instances (VMs) | Amazon EC2—resizable compute capacity with Intel, AMD, and Graviton processors  | Web and application hosting, data processing, high-performance computing
Batch processing  | AWS Batch—Dynamically run massive batch computing workloads based on the number and resource requirements of the batch job  | Data processing, machine learning training, and financial modeling
Scaling | Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling—add and remove compute capacity to match application demand | Scale EC2 instances and containers with dynamic and predictive scaling
Containers  | Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) | Host Docker containers with AWS ECS
. |  Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) | Store, manage, and deploy container images
. | Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)  | Fully managed Kubernetes service
. | Amazon EKS Anywhere | Run Kubernetes containers on customer-managed on-premises infrastructure
. | AWS Fargate | Serverless compute management for Docker and Kubernetes container deployments at AWS
. | Amazon ECS Anywhere | Run Dockers containers on customer-managed on-premises infrastructure
. | AWS App Runner  | Configure applications and deploy to AWS using a Git repository or a Docker image, without having to set up the underlying infrastructure
Serverless  | AWS Lambda  | Run custom functions for event-driven solutions without having to provision or manage servers
Edge and hybrid | AWS Outposts  | Bring native AWS services and infrastructure to your on-premises environments
. | AWS Local Zones | Run latency-sensitive workloads closer to on-premises data centers
. | AWS Wavelength Zones  | AWS cloud services and infrastructure hosted in third-party telecommunication data centers for developing and hosting 5G workloads
Capacity management | AWS Compute Optimizer | Recommend compute resources to improve workload performance and reduce costs
. | AWS Elastic Beanstalk | Deploy web applications running on instances and containers on AWS infrastructure services
. | ELB (ELB)  | Distribute requests to targeted EC2 instances and containers across multiple AZs
. | Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling | Scale workloads (web servers and databases) using dynamic and predictive scaling
