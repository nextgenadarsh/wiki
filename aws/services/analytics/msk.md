Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK)
---

- Streaming data can be consumed using a full-managed Apache Kafka and Kafka Connect Clusters hosted at AWS, allowing Kafka applications and Kafka connectors to run at AWS without requiring expert knowledge in operating Apache Kafka.
- can be `used to build a real-time data pipeline` that `streams data between applications and data stores`, or for building a real-time streaming application that can process and analyze data in real time.
- Amazon MSK `used with other AWS services`, such as Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon EMR, `can build complete data architectures on AWS`. 
- Amazon MSK is `built using Apache Kafka`; an open-source distributed event streaming platform used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications.
