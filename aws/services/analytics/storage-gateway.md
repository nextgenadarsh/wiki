Amazon Storage Gateway
---

- Connects an `on-premises software appliance with cloud-based storage` providing secure integration between an organizationâ€™s on-premises IT environment and the AWS S3 storage.

The Storage Gateway appliance is available in three different deployments:

- File Gateway
  - enables users to store files in Amazon S3, with local caching for low-latency access.
- Volume Gateway
  - provides block-level storage volumes that can be used as iSCSI targets, with local caching for low-latency access.
- Tape Gateway
  - emulates a tape library providing virtual tape infrastructure (VTI) that can be used with existing backup applications.
