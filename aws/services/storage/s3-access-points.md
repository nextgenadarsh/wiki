Amazon S3 Access Points
---

- You can simplify access to objects stored in Amazon S3 buckets from multiple AWS locations by creating Amazon S3 access endpoints that are directly attached to specific Amazon S3 buckets.
- Each Amazon S3 access point can have different permissions and network controls for requests made through the access point.
- The following are key features of S3 access points:
  - S3 access points can deploy an optional AWS IAM policy.
  - Access points block public access by default.
  - Access points can have permissions defined for IAM users and groups, and specific applications.
  - Access points can be configured to accept requests only from a VPC.
