Domain 1: Development with AWS Services
===

# Task Statement 1: Develop code for applications hosted on AWS.

Knowledge of:
===

## Architectural patterns (for example, event-driven, microservices, monolithic, choreography, orchestration, fanout)

## Idempotency

## Differences between stateful and stateless concepts

## Differences between tightly coupled and loosely coupled components

## Fault-tolerant design patterns (for example, retries with exponential backoff and jitter, dead-letter queues)

## Differences between synchronous and asynchronous patterns

Skills in
===

## Creating fault-tolerant and resilient applications in a programming language (for example, Java, C#, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go)

## Creating, extending, and maintaining APIs (for example, response/request transformations, enforcing validation rules, overriding status codes)

## Writing and running unit tests in development environments (for example, using AWS Serverless Application Model [AWS SAM])

## Writing code to use messaging services

## Writing code that interacts with AWS services by using APIs and AWS SDKs

## Handling data streaming by using AWS services

# Task Statement 2: Develop code for AWS Lambda.

Knowledge of
===

## Event source mapping

## Stateless applications

## Unit testing

## Event-driven architecture

## Scalability

## The access of private resources in VPCs from Lambda code

Skills in
===

## Configuring Lambda functions by defining environment variables and parameters (for example, memory, concurrency, timeout, runtime, handler, layers, extensions, triggers, destinations)

## Handling the event lifecycle and errors by using code (for example, Lambda Destinations, dead-letter queues)

## Writing and running test code by using AWS services and tools

## Integrating Lambda functions with AWS services

## Tuning Lambda functions for optimal performance

# Task Statement 3: Use data stores in application development.

Knowledge of
===

## Relational and non-relational databases

## Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations

## High-cardinality partition keys for balanced partition access

## Cloud storage options (for example, file, object, databases)

## Database consistency models (for example, strongly consistent, eventually consistent)

## Differences between query and scan operations

## Amazon DynamoDB keys and indexing

## Caching strategies (for example, write-through, read-through, lazy loading,TTL)

## Amazon S3 tiers and lifecycle management

## Differences between ephemeral and persistent data storage patterns

Skills in
===

## Serializing and deserializing data to provide persistence to a data store

## Using, managing, and maintaining data stores

## Managing data lifecycles

## Using data caching services
