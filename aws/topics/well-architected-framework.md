Well-Architected Framework
---

# AWS Well-Architected Tool

- A `self-paced utility` that `consists of Well-Architected Framework questions from each pillar` to make you consider which best practices and procedures should be considered when hosting your workloads at AWS.
- Contains `best practices` for designing reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective systems.
- Helps you `identify potential areas of medium and high risk`, based on your answers to the questions
- AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud all have their `own well-architected frameworks` (WAFs) as guidance

# 6 Pillars of Well-Architected Framework

## Operational Excellence

- How best to design, deploy, execute, and monitor applications running at AWS using automated deployment monitoring procedures, continuous improvement, and `automated` solutions for `recovering from failures`.
- One common thread is woven throughout the operational excellence pillar: performing detailed monitoring of all aspects of each workload during the prepare, operate, and evolve phases.
- Best practice areas for achieving and maintaining operational excellence:
  - Organize
  - Prepare
  - Operate
  - Evolve

## Security

- How to best design systems that will `operate reliably and securely` while protecting customer information and data records

## Reliability

- How applications hosted at AWS `recover from disruption` with minimal downtime and how applications `meet escalating demands`.

## Performance Efficiency

- How to use compute resources to `meet and maintain your application requirements` on an ongoing basis.

## Cost Optimization

- How to design workloads that `meet your needs at the lowest price point`.

## Sustainability

- How to designing workload deployments that `minimize waste`.
