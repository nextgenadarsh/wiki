# Well-Architected Framework

## 1. Operational Excellence

- Ability to support development and `run workloads` effectively, gain `insight` into their operations, and to continuously improve supporting `processes` and procedures to deliver business value.
- ability to `run and monitor` systems to deliver business value

### Principles

- Perform operations as code
- Annotated documentation
- Make frequent, small, reversible changes
- Refine operations procedures frequently
- Anticipate failure
- Learn from all operational failures

## 2. Security

- Ability to `protect` data, systems, and assets while delivering business value through `risk` assessements and `mitigation` strategies

### Principles

- Implement a strong `identity` foundation
- Enable `traceability`
- Apply security at all `layers`
- Automate security best practices
- Protect data in transit and at rest
- Keep people `away from data`
- Prepare for `security events`

## 3. Reliability

- Ability of a system to `perform its intended function` correctly and `consistently` when it's expected to. This includes the ability to `operate and test` the workload through its total lifecycle

### Principles

- Automatically `recover` from failures
- Test recovery procedures
- Scale horizontally to increase `aggregate` system availability
- `Stop guessing` capacity
- Manage change in automation

## 4. Performance Efficiency

- Ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to `maintain that efficiency` as demand changes and technology evolve.

### Principles

- Democratize advanced technologies
- `Go global` in minutes
- Use `serverless` architectures
- `Experiment` more often using temporary test environment
- Mechanical sympathy

## 5. Cost Optimization

- Ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.

### Principles

- Adopt a `consumption model`
- Measure overall efficiency
- Stop spending money on data center operations
- Analyze and attribute expenditure
- Use managed servcies to `reduce cost` of ownership

## 6. Sustainability

- Ability to focus on `environmental impacts`, especially `enery consumption` and efficiency, since they are important levers for architects to inform direct `action to reduce resources usage`.

 continously improve sustainability impacts by reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency across all components of a workload by maximizing the benefits from the provisioned resources and minimizing total resource required.

### Principles

- Understand your impact
- Establish sustainability goals
- `Maximize utilization`
- Anticipate and adopt new, more `efficient hardware and software` offerings
- Use managed services
- Reduce the `downstream impact` of your cloud workloads
